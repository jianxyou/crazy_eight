# crazy_eight


This Project consists of the implementation of a simulation of a game of Crazy Eights Countdown, which is a variant of the card game Crazy Eights (the eight). A game of Crazy Eights is played as follows: each player starts with 8 cards. The first card of the deck is exposed and forms the heel (discard pile). The first player must then play on the heel a card of the same suit (suit) or the same rank (rank) that is in his hand. It is now the turn of the next player to get rid of a card of the same suit or the same rank as the previous player (thus the card that is on top of the stock) and so on. If a player cannot play a valid card, he must draw a card from the top of the deck (without playing it). When there are no cards left in the deck, all cards in the stock pile except the first are shuffled and become the new deck. The object of the game is to get rid of all the cards in our hand as quickly as possible. When a player has only one card, that player must knock on the table to warn the other players.
